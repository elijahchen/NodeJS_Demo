# NodeJS_Demo
Repository exists to test Node.js, I will be experimenting with packages and familiarizing myself with Node.js!

There will be a few random packages that serve little real world purpose within this project.
The most important feature that I will be testing is the Express package.

Within this project, I hope to understand:
- What is a framework?
- What are the differences between framework and a library?
- What is Express?
- Why do people use Express?
