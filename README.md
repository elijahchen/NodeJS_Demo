# NodeJS_Demo
Repository exists to test Node.js, I will be experimenting with packages and familiarizing myself with Node.js!

There will be a few random packages that serve little real world purpose within this project.
The most important feature that I will be testing is the Express package.

Within this project, I hope to understand:
- What is a framework?
      Within a framework are predefined spots which I can fill it out with my code.
- What are the differences between framework and a library?
      You can call a library, however a framework calls you. The control is inverted.
- What is Express?
      The glue that allows JavaScript to be used outside the Web Browsers, for creating web and network applications. You can create the         server and server-side code for an application like most of the other web languages but in JS!
- Why do people use Express?
      Express is by far the most popular node framework and the most downloaded, more so because the community for Express is very large.
